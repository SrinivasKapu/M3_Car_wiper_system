# M3_Car_wiper_system


### SOFTWARE REQUIRMENTS:
* STM32CUBEIDE
* CYGWIN
* QEMU
### COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT:
* STM32F407G-DISC1
STM32F407 series of microcontrollers are high-performance MCUs designed for medical, industrial and consumer applications. It is based on ARM Cortex-M4 and offers up to 168MHz. The STM32F407VGT6 is the onboard chip which comes in a 100-pin LQFP package.

The STM32F407G-DISC1 is a Discovery Kit allows users to easily develop applications with the STM32F407 high performance microcontrollers with ARM cortex-M4 32-bit core. It includes everything required either for beginners or for experienced users to get quickly started. Based on the STM32F407VGT6, it includes an ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A embedded debug tool, two ST MEMS digital accelerometers, a digital microphone, one audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs and push buttons and an USB OTG micro-AB connector.
